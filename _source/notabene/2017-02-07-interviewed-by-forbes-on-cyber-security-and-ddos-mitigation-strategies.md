I was honored this week to be [interviewed][ln1] by [Forbes][ln2] on a cyber security Q&A piece on how to mitigate DDoS attacks:

> Although total victory over hackers may be impossible, we can combat their efforts via a balanced approach that focuses as much on mitigating exploits as on preventing them. Develop a security strategy that can only be beaten by physical attacks, limits the scope of attacks to individual devices, and secures data at each step in the pipeline based on whether it is at rest, in motion, or in use.
