Here is the original paper on DTLS, the security basis for CoAP/UDP from [Nagendra Modadugu][ln2] and [Eric Rescorla][ln3]:

> Applications that are based on reliable transport can be secured using TLS, but no compelling alternative exists for securing datagram-based applications. In this paper we present DTLS, a datagram-capable version of TLS.

Well written.
