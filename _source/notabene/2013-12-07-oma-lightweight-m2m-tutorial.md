From Zach Shelby of [Sensinode (now ARM)][ln0], a short primer on OMA LWM2M. There's more on the most recent LWM2M spec and roadmap plans [at OMA][ln2]:

> Further standardization will enhance the support of a wide variety of M2M implementations, and will become necessary as the market expands.

Next OMA member meeting is in Sorrento, Italy (February 2014).
