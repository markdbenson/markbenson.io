Sam Trendall, writing for Channelnomics, quoting a [recent IDC report][ln2] by Scott Tiazkun on the IoT:

> The Internet of Things market must be understood in terms of vertical markets because the value of IoT is based on individual use cases across all markets.

Indeed, the growth in IoT will not be from the *mass production* of a few high volume devices. Rather, it will be of the *mass customization* of many small volume devices.
