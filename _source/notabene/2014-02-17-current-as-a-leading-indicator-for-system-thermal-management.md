Dan Harmon, Sensing Business Development Director for Texas Instruments, writing for Electronic Design:

> Many systems use thermistors or temperature sensors to monitor the temperature at key locations in the system. While this works fine, measuring the temperature means that we are monitoring a secondary or lagging indicator. 

Interesting approach. The idea of measuring current rather than temperature for predicting thermal performance is a good one since it gets us closer to the root cause of head in embedded systems: power.
