Pablo Valerio, writing for EE Times, quoting Adam Gould, Vice President of the Sensinode Business at ARM:

> We need standards at the radio level, the security layer, and the data format level... For developers it is necessary that they know that those devices are going to be able to talk to each other and [that they] really focus on the application.

This industry is still just getting organized. I agree with Adam. The best is yet to come and the first step is connecting devices based on open standards like [CoAP][ln1].
