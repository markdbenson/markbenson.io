Ryan Daws, on the visceral reaction against Google's recent acquisition of Nest, and the emerging reality of pervasive computing in our lives:

> Well I’m sorry to be blunt, but if you want this world you’re going to have to give up some privacy. 

This issue has less to do with privacy than it does with trust. Nest owners that were previously happy, are now unhappy because of their distrust of the unknwn future of their private information with Google.
