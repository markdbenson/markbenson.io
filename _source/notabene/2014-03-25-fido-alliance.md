About the FIDO Alliance:

> The FIDO Alliance plans to change the nature of authentication by developing specifications that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that supplant reliance on passwords to securely authenticate users of online services.

Trading simplicity (no passwords) can at times come at the cost of high security. However, I like the line of thinking that makes simplifying assumptions such as if a person is near to a device (physical proximity), they are very likely authorized to provision and use that device.
