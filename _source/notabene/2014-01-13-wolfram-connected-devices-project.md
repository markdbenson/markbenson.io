Wolfram just announced their [Connected Devices Project][ln1]:

> [...] today we’re launching the Wolfram Connected Devices Project—whose goal is to work with device manufacturers and the technical community to provide a definitive, curated, source of systematic knowledge about connected devices.

Built, of course, on the [Wolfram Language][ln2].
