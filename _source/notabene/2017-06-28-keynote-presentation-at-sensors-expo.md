I was honored to [deliver a keynote presentation last week on behalf of Exosite][ln1] at [Sensors Expo in San Jose][ln2] on how Conway's Law (systems mimic the organizations that produce them) leads to the inevitable fragmentation of IoT solutions, and how the "Inverted Conway Maneuver" (deploying technology that mimics the way you want your future organization to behave) is key to solving people problems through the intelligent application of IoT technology.
