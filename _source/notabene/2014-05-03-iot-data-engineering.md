Dan Woods, writing for Forbes:

> The bounding condition in deploying the Internet of Things (IoT) is not going to be the deployment of devices but rather the management and analysis of the data coming off those devices. If you are interested in making use of the IoT, thatâ€™s what you need to be working on: Data Engineering.

I disagree that the deployment of IoT is "not a problem". However, it's true that the problem of dealing with large unstructured data streams is where the true dragons and opportunities are.
