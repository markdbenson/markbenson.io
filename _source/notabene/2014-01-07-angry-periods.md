[Ben Crair][ln1], interviewing [Mark Liberman][ln2] -- professor of linguistics at the [University of Pennsylvania][ln3] -- on the evolving meaning of the full stop:

> “In the world of texting and IMing … the default is to end just by stopping, with no punctuation mark at all,” Liberman wrote me. “In that situation, choosing to add a period also adds meaning because the reader(s) need to figure out why you did it. [...]

I'm still clinging to the virtues of properly-punctuated text messages, but it's admittedly a dying (dare I say grotesque?) art. I wonder what sort of punctuation we'll use to communicate internet-connected machine statuses 10 years from now. Is it time to finally [canonize a set of standard irony and sarcasm][ln4] marks, but for machines only?
