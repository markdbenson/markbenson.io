Honored to be [interviewed](http://iotdesign.embedded-computing.com/articles/it-ot-and-vying-for-control-of-the-iot-connectivity-platform/) by [Brandon Lewis](https://twitter.com/TechieLew) at [Embedded Computing Design](http://embedded-computing.com/) on "IT, OT, and vying for control of the IoT connectivity platform" as part of their [IoT Design initiative](http://iotdesign.embedded-computing.com/).

Here's a quote from the interview:

> I’ve seen companies hire data scientists to try and figure out what’s going on with their data, but they haven’t captured enough data for the data scientist to actually do anything, and the data scientists don’t understand the machines well enough to know how to instrument them to get the answers that they want. So it turns into this cycle of inefficiency where if companies don’t get the first part right – which is basic connectivity, adding sensors to machines, getting data flowing, and learning to collect data on failures – if they don’t do that first they won’t ever be successful adding data scientists to their teams and driving true operational efficiency.
