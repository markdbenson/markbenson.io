GE is planning to "release public APIs" for their Predix platform. Nikhil Chauhan, director of product marketing for GE Software:

> Predix is a set of IoT applications designed to merge the physical worlds of machines with analytical data to create software-defined machines that will ultimately eliminate unplanned downtime [...]

Making an API public is not big news in itself. However, if an API becomes widely used, it could trump other lesser-used APIs that are coming out of the standards bodies (ETSI, OneM2M, etc.).
