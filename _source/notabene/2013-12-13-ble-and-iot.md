Stacey Higginbotham:

> The final tweak is a bit vague, but involves giving Bluetooth devices a way to talk directly to the internet by giving them some kind of dedicated channel, which could be used for IPv6 communications. But because Bluetooth is a low-power protocol, implementing IPv6 could require more battery power than is wise. So how the SIG or chipmakers add IPv6 compatibility to Bluetooth-power devices seems to need a bit more explanation and development from the chipmakers.

There has been [quite a bit of work in this area at the IETF since April of 2011][ln2].
