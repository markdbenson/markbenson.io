PTC just acquired ThingWorx for $112M:

Incidentally, PTC also owns the venerable Pro/Engineer (now [Creo][ln1]), which is a great piece of 2D CAD software.

> The acquisition is expected to add more than $10 million of revenue over the next 12 months, with $5 million to $7 million of revenue in FY'14.

Given an annual turnover of <$10M, that's a pretty nice valuation for ThingWorx (>10x). (PTC's FY'13 revenue was $1.3 billion.)
