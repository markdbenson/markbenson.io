[James Anderson][ln1] writing for [IoT World News][ln2] on the [recent security and privacy report][ln3] by the [Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG)][ln4]:

> Critical observations accounted for a massive portion of the 43-page report, but it ultimately centered on the inability of IoT device manufacturers and lack of incentive to adapt to new security challenges.

*Inability* and *lack of incentive* are two aspects of security for manufacturers that I'm sure will change significantly in 2017.
