[Michael Simon][ln1], CEO of [LogMeIn][ln2][^1], writing for [CNBC][ln3]:

[^1]: LogMeIn, [in 2011][ln4], purchased Pachube for $15 million and renamed it Cosm, then subsequently to [Xively][ln5]. 

> Among C-level executives at product manufacturers and businesses in general, the Internet of Things (IoT) will be transitioning from "what and why" to "when and how."

This is consistent with what I've seen as well. Companies in 2014 seem to be moving towards making real plans around IoT initiatives as opposed to just learning about what it is.
