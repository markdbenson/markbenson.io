Varun Nagaraj:

> The differences between the IIoT and IoT are not just a matter of slight degree or semantics. If your Fitbit or Nest device fails, it might be inconvenient. But if a train braking system fails, it could be a matter of life and death.

Not all IIoT applications are a matter of life and death, but it's true that industrial requirements for reliability, safety, and security are usually more stringent than with consumer applications.
