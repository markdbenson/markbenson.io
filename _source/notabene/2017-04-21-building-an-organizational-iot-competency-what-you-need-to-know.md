Honored to be [published][ln1] in [Forbes][ln2] this week on how organizations can build an IoT competency.

> **The Road To Unconscious Competence**

> In the field of psychology, the “conscious competence” learning model  describes how individuals move from incompetence to competence in a certain subject area as they move from unconscious incompetence (naiveté about the competency deficit) to conscious incompetence (acknowledgment that there is competency deficit) to conscious competence (demonstrated competency through a concerted effort) to unconscious competence (competency as second nature).

> This same model of “conscious competence” is true for organizations faced with the task of digital transformation through smart connected products, a visual depiction of which appears [here][ln3].

> There is no shortcut to mastery. Identification of gaps followed by planning, execution, growth and institutionalization of process and behavior are necessary waypoints on the journey to IoT competency.
