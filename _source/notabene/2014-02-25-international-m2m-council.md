The [IMC][ln1] is gaining momentum:

> The IMC will roll out its new IoT Content Library, which includes over 50 case studies emphasizing ROI for M2M deployments, during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

No doubt the biggest reason for the growth of the IMC is due to the collection and dissemination of business case studies and ROI models.
