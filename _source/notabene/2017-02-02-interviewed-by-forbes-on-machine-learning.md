Honored to be [interviewed by Forbes][ln1] this week in a piece on machine learning and analytics:

> "The road to advanced analytics and machine learning starts with basic connectivity and data collection. This journey includes pinpointing the questions that need to be answered with data analysis, identifying the data needed to answer those questions, and putting processes in place to gather the correct type and amount of that data to properly support machine learning."

Also, [Kurt Dykema][ln2] was interviewed in the same piece, saying that the first step is to start with an internal project based on a passion to solve an interesting problem:

> Find an interesting problem that the team wants to crack, and let them develop their skills in machine learning while they work on a problem they are passionate about.`
