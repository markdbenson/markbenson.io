ABSTRACT: The invention provides methods for providing a unified single-scan user interface for accessing and managing a remotely located device throughout its life cycle, including cellular network provisioning, cloud data provider registration, initialization and activation, as well as providing end users with easy access to the device and its data. The end user simply powers the device on and the device automatically connects with the communication network and the cloud data provider. The device comes to the end user already provisioned and paired and activated with the cloud data provider and the communication network provider. The end user may provision the device by scanning an optically scannable identification label having device-specific data embedded thereon using a mobile device such as a smartphone or the like.
