ABSTRACT: A modularized intermediate communication device for a sensor network includes multiple electronic modules assembled in a stack and configured to communicate with one another. Each of the stackable electronic modules includes housing including first and second stacking portions mechanically complementary to each other. Each module further includes a first inter-module communication connector arranged on the first stacking portion, a second inter-module communication connector arranged on the second stacking portion, and a communication device electrically connected to the first and second inter-module communication connectors and communicating with a matching electronic module using at least one communication protocol.
