ABSTRACT: A network-connected object for performing a function and communicating with a server computing device via a network includes a functional object, application-specific input/output (I/O) device, and a gateway device. The functional object is configured to perform a function. The application-specific I/O device includes an electronic circuit configured to perform an application-specific function related to the functional object. The gateway device includes a first communication device configured for data communication with the application-specific I/O device, a second communication device configured for data communication with the server computing device, at least one processing device, and at least one computer readable storage device. The gateway device is configured to receive a command and a profile identifier from the application-specific I/O device, determine a client identification key associated with the profile identifier, and transmit the command with the client identification key to the server computing device.
