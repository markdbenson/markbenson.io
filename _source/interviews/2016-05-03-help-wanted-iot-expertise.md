[Interviewed][ln1] by [Larry Greenemeier][ln2] for a series in [The Economist][ln3] sponsored by [Samsung][ln4] called [The Connected Enterprise][ln5] about the skill shortage that many companies are facing for the pending wave of IoT projects.

> ABSTRACT: Today, thereâ€™s no shortage of bold strategic visions for the Internet of Things. But none of these can be realized if organizations lack the skills needed to identify or invent the right types of sensors, gather the data those sensors produce, secure that data and make sense of them across various business units. In short: They need talent to turn IoT potential into reality.
