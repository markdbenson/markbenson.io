[Interviewed][ln1] for a piece by [Wes Davis][ln2] in [The Hive][ln3] about the Matter standard and how SmartThings will pioneer support for this new and exciting smart home standard, including key partnerships with Google and Amazon.

> Our goal is to deliver robust Matter Controller support on SmartThings/Aeotec hubs and Samsung products that support integrated SmartThings Hub software. SmartThings users will be able to build powerful automations that work seamlessly with smart home devices across Matter, Zigbee, and Z-Wave protocols.
>
> Our initial focus for enhanced multi-admin collaboration with Google is on Android platforms. Support for other operating systems will be considered in the future. Note that once Matter devices are onboarded to the SmartThings platform, they can be monitored/controlled from the SmartThings client app running on any platform.
