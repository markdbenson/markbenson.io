[Interviewed][ln1] by [Alec Sears][ln2] for an article in [Datafloq
][ln3] that explores common mistakes that derail IoT projects.

> Many companies get into a large IoT project only to realize it demands extensive expertise in hardware, software, security, marketing, and other areas. Mark Benson, chief technology officer of Exosite and member of the Forbes Technology Council, offers sound advice, saying smart companies “start their journey with simple discrete IoT applications that provide short-term economic gains and insights about what customers value, both of which inform the organization’s long-term IoT strategy and journey toward becoming a digital company.”
