[Interiewed][ln1] by [Brandon Lewis][ln2] for a piece in [Embedded Computing Design][ln3] as part of their [IoT Design][ln4] series on how IoT platforms bridge the two worlds of IT and OT (operational technology).

> ABSTRACT: Internet of Things (IoT) “platform” has become a term as nebulous as “cloud” was a decade ago, partly because the technologies are still taking shape. However, there are clear differences between an IoT connectivity platform that serves industrial markets and those for the consumer IoT, such as reliability, security, and integration with highly specific enterprise services like building and plant management systems. But since Industrial IoT (IIoT) platforms touch so many parts of both the operational technology (OT) on the plant floor as well as backend IT operations, who should control them? Mark Benson, CTO of IoT software platform vendor Exosite gives his opinion.
