[Interviewed][ln1] by [Stacey Higginbotham][ln2] for a piece about SmartThings and a proactive and bold shift in product strategy coming soon for SmartThings to enable a high degree of differentiation in the coming age of smart home experiences.

> SmartThings is pushing these changes because the smart home is finally getting to a point where users are comfortable buying devices and automating some things. But to take it to the next level, it has to get much, much easier. Benson’s lofty talk of “experiences,” covers a lot of ground, but the basic gist is that when someone buys a connected product in the future and brings it home to a SmartThings ecosystem, they should expect it to automatically connect and then to get suggestions about how that device might fit into their current apps or experiences running on the platform.
