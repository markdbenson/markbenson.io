[Interviewed][ln1] by [Alan Griffiths][ln2] from [Cambashi][ln3] for a piece in [The Manufacturer][ln4] on trends in Internet-connected products for industrial applications (the so called Industrial Internet of Things):

> Mark Benson, chief technology officer of Exosite, says, “In the short term, we see trends moving towards more analytics offerings and related integrated services, more focus on device-to-cloud security offerings, and continued merger and acquisition consolidation.
> 
> “In the long term, we anticipate integrated augmented-reality services; the commoditisation of the cost of basic device management in order to lure more sales in analytics and business-process automation, and that IIoT PaaS (platform as a service) will become part of the standard enterprise it portfolio – similar to CRM and ERP.”
