[Interviewed][ln1] by [Forbes][ln2] for a piece on artificial intelligence (AI) and how its use will impact the way companies do business going forward.

> Much of the fear with AI is due to the misunderstanding of what it is and how it should be applied. Although AI has promise for solving complex social problems, there are ethical issues and biases we must still explore. We are just beginning to understand how AI can be applied to meaningful problems. As our use of AI matures, we will find it to be a clear benefit in our lives.
