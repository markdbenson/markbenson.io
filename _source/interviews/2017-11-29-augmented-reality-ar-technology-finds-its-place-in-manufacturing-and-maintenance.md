[Interviewed][ln1] by Dan Rafter for [Distributed Energy Magazine][ln2] on augmented reality and it's potential to increase efficiency and safety for industrial and commercial applications.

> With industrial, the social situation is much different. Someone wearing a hardhat fitted with sensors isn’t worried about how it looks. In industrial uses, the outcomes are what matter. If you can show that wearing a helmet with sensors can make workers more efficient, that this product can save money, that’s what matters. So it doesn’t surprise me that AR technology is finding a second life in terms of industrial use.
