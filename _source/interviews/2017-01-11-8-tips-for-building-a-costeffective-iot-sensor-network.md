[Interviewed][ln1] by John Edwards from [Computer World][ln2] on building cost-effective IoT sensor networks:

> [...] companies that address sensor network deployment via a crawl-walk-run approach tend to achieve the greatest cost efficiencies, says Mark Benson, CTO of Exosite, a Minneapolis company that develops IoT software. "Key to building a cost-effective sensor network that scales in an efficient manner are [organizations] that start small, learn quickly and grow over time, all while ensuring that they are focusing their measurement efforts on the parameters that are closely correlated with finding anomalies and trends that make an impact on the business.
