[Interviewed][ln1] by [Brian Martucci][ln2] for a piece in [The Line Magazine][ln3] on why the Minneapolis St. Paul area of Minnesota has a rich ecosystem of Interent of Things technology product and service companies.

> ABSTRACT: Currently MSP boasts a lively, innovative IoT scene that produces connected devices, and systems that make them easier to use, for businesses and consumers alike. There’s even a movement afoot to rebrand MSP as “IoT Alley” in recognition of its historical and contemporary contributions to the field. (Though Boston-area techies claim ownership of the “IoT Alley” label too.) Whatever you want to call it, there’s no denying that MSP is leading the march toward a future in which even the most mundane objects — furniture, apparel, lawn sprinklers — plug into the cloud and communicate with the wider world.
