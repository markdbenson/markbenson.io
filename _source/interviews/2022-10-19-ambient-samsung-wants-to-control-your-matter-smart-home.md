[Interviewed][ln1] for a piece by [Paul Lamkin][ln2] in [The Ambient][ln3] on how Samsung's SmartThings is set to support the Matter smart home standard with its hubs (including the Aeotec Hub V3), acting as Matter controllers. These hubs will enable easier integration of devices through Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Thread compatibility. The article goes on to cover how Samsung aims to simplify smart home setups by making devices more interoperable and less complex -- a major barrier to adoption. 

> “That experience is something that we definitely brought to the table, and that that includes all kinds of obvious things around just getting devices to work together in an interoperable way,” Benson explained.
> 
> “I think better than anybody, when it comes to aggregating this fragmented ecosystem of devices, it’s been a driving focus for SmartThings since the beginning.
> 
> “Just working across brands ands protocols, and being able to have a smart home that’s easy to manage, even though you have multiple brands in your home.”
