One of my high-school bands was named Factor 8 (think proverbial Eight Ball)
and I played bass. My brother Brian was kind enough to dig up a little ear
candy from "the early years." If you've ever been interested in knowing how a
couple of pimply-faced teenagers interpret "alternative funkadelic hillbilly
folk", by all means have a listen.


Before you download the song, you should know that Factor 8 was inextricably
inspired by the following musical grandfathers: Clapton, Hendrix, The 5th
Dimension, Green Day, Nirvana, Filter, and most importantly Cotton-Eyed Joe.
See if you you can pick up the following subtleties (extra points if you can
spot the theme):

  * 0:00 - Amazingly bad bass solo in the wrong time signature
  * 0:07 - Bass slide
  * 0:11 - Bass slide
  * 0:38 - Percussive bass slap!
  * 0:52 - Bass slide
  * 1:20 - Stolen bass solo ((C) Clapton/Cream)
  * 1:33 - Bass slide
  * 1:39 - Bass slide
  * 1:54 - Bass slide
  * 2:10 - Bass slide
