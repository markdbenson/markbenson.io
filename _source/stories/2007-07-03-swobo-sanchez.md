In the interest of simplified terrestrial locomotion, I recently shed two old
bicycles and acquired an urban boneshaker made of galvanized CroMo with low-
profile road tires, a single fixed gear, and no brakes.

Thanks to the [Fixed Gear Gallery](http://fixedgeargallery.com/) and [One on
One Bicycle Studio](http://www.oneononebike.com/), I've fallen unashamedly
deep into single-speed dementia. Bikes are meant to be simple, and this is
about as simple as it gets--I couldn't be happier.

For those who are interested, the two bikes I sold were: (1) a [2001 Schwinn
Mesa GSX](http://flickr.com/photos/markbenson/585920553/) mountain bike, and
(2) a [1987 Peugeot Corbier
(P4)](http://flickr.com/photos/markbenson/585987410/) road bike. Also, I have
more [photos of the Sanchez on

you'd like to see more.
