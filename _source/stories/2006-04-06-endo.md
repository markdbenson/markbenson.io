The first time I tried an
[endo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endo_%28cycling%29) to impress some
friends, my [10-speed
Peugeot](http://www.classicrendezvous.com/France/Peugeot/Peugeot_PZ_full.htm)
decided it was time to do its best imitation of a stubborn mule, causing my
sans-helmet oversized biscuit to say "Hello Mr. Asphalt."


## Evel Knievel

In a similar feat of machismo, I attempted to jump a sand hill in the gravel
pit in my backyard that was way too big to be safe. I started at the top, rode
my bike down part way, launched off a mini plauteau, and landed after free-
falling 10 vertical feet, only to discover later while I was laying on my back
that I not only didn't land the jump, but I had racked my jimmies in a
terrible way.

## Super Dave Osborne

Still another time, while riding bike to a friends house, I decided to brave
the entire distance with no paws on the tiller. Along the way, I rode by a
group of people, backyard-grilling. As I tried to get them to notice that I
was riding no-handed, I crashed into the back of a parked car, crumpling my
front rim, bruising my elbow, and landing half on the top of the trunk with my
lips pressed against the rear windshield. One guy heard the wreck, ran to me,
and said, "What the hell were you trying to do? You should go home boy."

We stunt men have boldness in our blood; it's a viscious cycle.
