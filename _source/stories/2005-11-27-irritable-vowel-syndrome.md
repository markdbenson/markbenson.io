You see, I have this condition. It's my larynx. Whenever I try to speak a word
with an open configuration of my vocal tract (AKA, a vowel), I end up sounding
like some pimply seahorse hiding in a treasure chest in the middle of
pimpleshire. It's not good, I'm telling you.


I just diagnosed myself with this disorder tonight, so let me explain it to
you since it will not appear in your textbooks.

## Features

IVS, or "Sp:as:tic: C:olo:n", is a group of Functional Vowel Disorders and is
fairly rare. IVS usually rears its ungraceful head when
[diphthongs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong) are violently spouted
really really fast. Examples:

  * Orange
  * Flower
  * Yawn
  * Pause
  * Noise
  * Royal
  * The epitome of femininity

## Symptoms

The symptoms of IVS are sometimes hard to spot, but often fall into the
following categories:

  * Recurrently awkward social situations
  * People around you usually observe that you "mumble a lot", or something analogous
  * Your vocal intonations blend in freakishly with the hum of cheap electronics equipment

## Treatment

Treatment involves two of the following three prescriptions:

  * Gargling
  * Coughing (or hawking a couple [loogies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loogie))
  * A kick in the ass

## Prognosis

IVS is not fatal nor is it linked to the development of other serious vowel
disorders. However, the following behaviors, and other negative quality-of-
life effects can be common in more serious cases.

  * Chronic emotional pain
  * Blows to the ego
  * Work absenteeism
  * Social phobias
  * Bed-wetting

Individuals lucky enough to find a successful treatment for their symptoms can
lead normal lives.
