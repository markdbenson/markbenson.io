As I'm sure all of you have heard by now, the I-35W bridge, spanning the
Mississippi river, [collapsed on Wednesday](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=br
idge+collapse+minnesota+news&m=tags&z=t&s=int). My family and close friends
are OK, but it hit close to home. I arrived on the scene 15 minutes after the
collapse on my bike (not knowing anything that was going on), to find that my
normal bike path was destroyed. Good thing I was running late I guess.

I spent 2 hours riding my bike around the bridge in astonishment at what had
just happened. There were already emergency crews on the scene, and they
didn't want any help from civilians. There were cars and trucks in the river,
and a bus full of school children that was sitting katywampus on the edge.

A few things I noticed:

  * The air smelled like burning rubber, and a number of people were already wearing scarves around their faces because of all the dust in the air.
  * A couple of civilians took it upon themselves to start directing traffic on University near the 35W on-ramps and exit-ramps but were getting yelled at by angry motorists.
  * Many emergency crews from around Minnesota started rolling in about an hour after the collapse. There were rescue boats, a floating crane, fire trucks, lots of undercover police cars, and a city bus that was converted so that it's LED sign read "RESCUE BUS".
  * Lots of pedestrians from the University of Minnesota were roaming around trying to take pictures and get a closer look. Some people were crying; some people were laughing; some people were getting their picture taken like a tourist; a large number of people were on their cell phones.

I heard an estimate through the news that 150,000 - 200,000 people travel that
bridge every day. Every one of those people are probably saying the same thing
right now: "I could have died." In fact, I've heard many people say just that.
It's a strangely unifying tragedy.

One of my friends works with someone who is among the missing. Another one of
my friends works with someone who broke their back in the collapse. Also, one
person I work with (a Mechanical Engineer) went down with the bridge in his
truck, but amazingly walked away with only scrapes and bruises.
