There is a winding and irregular road in [Brainerd,
MN](http://www.brainerd.com/) called the "Yee Yee Road" that exists for two
purposes: (1) to provide a paved path to and from homes in the woods, and (2)
to dispense titillating enjoyment to the hillbilly Benson/Schumann clan while
they raced their rusted [Chevy
Citation](http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/a/a1/Chevrolet-
Citation-84.jpg) over the hilly humps, with windows down, sans seat belts,
unashamedly hooting, "Yee Haw!" repeatedly throughout the mid-nineties.


Aunt Karen would dependably orchestrate amusing trips to the Yee Yee Road
which were usually proceeded by riding horses at the [Little Elk
Ranch](http://littleelkranch.com/) and sandwiched by [Mini
Golf](http://www.piratescove.net/location/12) (or Go-Karting, or the Batting
Cages), and [Rafferty's Pizza](http://www.raffertyspizza.com/). For me as a
kid, Brainerd was the definition of earthly euphoria.

My brother Brian reminded me of the Yee Yee Road this afternoon and pointed
out that many times, we would try to gain enough speed on the down-slope of
one hill so that we could retain enough speed on the up-slope of the next hill
to get a couple of tires off the road. Getting sweet air never gets old.
