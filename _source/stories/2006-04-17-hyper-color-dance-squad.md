In the Spring of 1994, [Ryan (Sloot Dog) Van Slooten, Chad (Carrot Top)
Schueller, and Mark (Sparkles)
Benson](http://www.flickr.com/photos/markbenson/56393332/) founded the Hyper-
Color Dance Squad (HCDS.) Heavily influenced by the provocative [MC
Hammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Hammer), the HCDS was most known for
their matching outfits consisting of neon-yellow silky shorts, tight black
shirts, dark shades, and [Saucony](http://www.saucony.com/) sneakers.


The HCDS specialized in synchronized
[breakdancing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing), to the tune of [U
Can't Touch This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Can%27t_Touch_This) ([MC
Hammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mc_hammer)), [My
Prerogative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Prerogative) ([Bobby
Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Brown)), and
[Jump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_%28Kris_Kross_song%29) ([Kris
Kross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criss_Cross_%28band%29).) Long and sweaty
summer afternoons were spent practicing in the garage between a drill press
and a table saw, perfecting the [6-step](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-step),
[Back Spin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_%28breakdancing_move%29), and
variations on the
[Suicide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_%28breakdancing_move%29).

The demise of the HCDS came quickly in the Fall of 1994, after having
performed for zero (0) people. The outfits were hung in the closet, the small
space in the garage began to close up with things stored for winter, and the
HCDS founding members entered the 9th grade.
