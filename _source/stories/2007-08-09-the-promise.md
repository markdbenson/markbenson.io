Earlier this spring, I made my first attempt at some graphic art. "The
Promise" was inspired by my hopes of getting outside for a summer hike in the
mountains, [like Mandy and I did on Mt. Rainier a few years
ago](http://jayber.org/2005/08/washington_high.html). Read on to view the

I started by vectorizing a photograph of a tree I liked, added layers of
mountain horizon, and planted a vertical rainbow right behind the tree. Also,
I used various grunge brushes to make the sun, and to add some scratches.

I picked a vertical rainbow because I like to think of rainbows being so
large, that at the point where they intersect the horizon, they appear to be
linear, straight up and down. To me this symbolizes both the enormity of
rainbows as well as the enormity of God's promise to Noah. 1

  1. Rainbows typically take the shape of an arc because of how light is [dispersed (refracted and reflected) through drops of water in the atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow). As far as I know, rainbows are never exactly straight. The closest thing I'm aware of is a [curcumhorizontal arc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumhorizontal_arc) (AKA fire rainbow). <\--
