The house next door to us exploded. It's not very often I get to write that!
Mandy and I woke up very early this morning to a loud blast that blew out the
windows on one side of our house, knocked pictures off the wall, smashed our
fence, and burned our yard.

After we woke up and saw that the neighborhood was glowing orange from the
resulting fire, I immediately called 911 and looked out one of the windows on
the side of our house to find that the house next door was enfulfed in flames
--all two stories of it! It only took the fire a couple of minutes before all
walls of the house completely burned down. The only thing left standing ended
up being the chimney.

Mandy and I got out of the house quickly in case it was natural gas, and on
the off-chance that each house on the block was going to start blowing up like
popcorn. Out on the street, people starting gathering. Some even woke up after
hearing the loud boom from almost a mile away. Fortunately, no one was injured
as the family that lived in the house was out of town. Thank God.

In case you're interested, here's some [more photos of all the
