Recently, Mandy and I dropped nine (9) fazolies on popcorn at the AMC. Before
sitting down, we made a pit stop at the automatic butter dispenser--a
monstrosity with a single over-sized yellow button (the size of my fist)
simply labeled, "Push for Butter."


We centered our bag under the spigot, pressed the yellow button, and were
simultaneously disgusted and amazed at the thickness and liquidity of the warm
and greasy stream that was noticeably filling up the bottom of the bag. Mmm.

Fast rewind 15 years. In Junior High, our school cafeteria tried out a new
condiment dispenser: an electronic ketchup squirter. Imagine the hilarity
others experienced as they watched me (wearing white jeans, and a white
t-shirt), walk up to the machine, press the button, and patiently wait, as the
machine burped an air bubble, and erupted ketchup all over my front-side.

I didn't think much about these things until a couple of days ago when I was
wolfing down a Chicken Bake at the Costco Food Court, when my buddy
[Matt](http://studiedspaces.blogspot.com/) pointed out a sauerkraut dispenser
bolted to the wall. It was the kind that had a whole crap load of sauerkraut
loaded into the top, and to get it out, you had to turn a crank. Kind of like
a [sausage maker](http://www.kitchenemporium.com/cgi-
bin/kitchen/prod/18ts61210.html), only for, well, you know... sauerkraut.

Condiment dispensers, I salute you.
