On Tuesday, I was sitting at my desk responding to an email when without
warning, my eyebrows twitched and dozens of goose pimples formed on my neck as
my body reacted to a disagreeable and breezy draft. I shivered and realized
that there were cars honking while a strange and unfamiliar voice said, "Well,
if I don't make it, tell my wife I love her."


Immediately, I snapped up like a rubber-necked prairie dog and found a strange
man on a wobbly ladder dangling out the 4th story window. Instantly, I knew
what was going on. Earlier that day, our office manager told me the Glass Man
was coming to replace a cracked window, which he had, and was performing an
amazing and treacherous act of bravery in order to do his job.

My job is nothing like that. My idea of "amazing" is elegantly coercing an LCD
display to draw an animated arc. My idea of "treachery" is writing code that
is highly-coupled or not cohesive. My idea of "bravery" is coding a tricky
algorithm to convert ballistic coordinates from 3-dimensional spherical space,
to 2-dimensional cartesian, or using Internet Explorer. I don't do cool things
like hang out windows, or have regular needs to tell co-workers to convey
amorous feelings to my wife "in case I don't make it."

Glass Man, I salute you.
