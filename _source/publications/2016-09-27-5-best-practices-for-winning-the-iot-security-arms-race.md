> ABSTRACT: The battle between hackers of IoT products and the businesses that produce them is an arms race that is escalating in erratic fashion. New advancements in technology have enabled new types of Internet-connected products, thereby expanding the overall threat surface and opening up new opportunities for would-be attackers to wreak havoc. As enterprises struggle to respond, their behaviors can sadly be classified as either naive or fearful, neither of which produce effective results. This article explains the IoT security arms race between corporations and attackers and makes key recommendations on how to “win” the race via thoughtful approaches that balance usability and security in a way that keeps the cost to attack higher than the reward of achieving it. Examples and references to several industries will be provided including technology, manufacturing and healthcare.
