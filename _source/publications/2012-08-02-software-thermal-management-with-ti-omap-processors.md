> ABSTRACT: TI OMAP applications processors are powerful and flexible; this makes them well suited for managing difficult power and thermal constraints.

> However, the complexity of OMAP parts is high and the ways in which to use them are varied and intricate.  

> This article addresses the problem of managing thermal performance in a battery-powered product design with TI OMAP processors, and also includes a special case study on the OMAP4430-based Amazon Kindle Fire.
