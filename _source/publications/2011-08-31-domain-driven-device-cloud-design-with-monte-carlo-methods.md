> ABSTRACT: Cloud computing is an emerging trend. Consequently, more and more embedded devices are becoming connected to "The Cloud." Features that were previously included on the device are now being moved to The Cloud and provided as a service. 

> This trend not only requires a new way of thinking about system design, but also enables a new level of algorithmic analysis that is moving us closer to unlocking the true promise of device clouds: data visualization.
