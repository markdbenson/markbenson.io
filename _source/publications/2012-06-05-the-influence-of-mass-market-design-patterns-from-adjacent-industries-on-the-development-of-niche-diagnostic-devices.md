> ABSTRACT: As the state of the art in diagnostic devices evolves within the context of our flattening world economy, manufacturers are facing key defining challenges that affect not only business performance, but also users and patients: uncertain regulatory landscapes, increasingly-demanding user expectations, and tightening cost pressures. 

> By analyzing and implementing design patterns from adjacent industries, we can influence diagnostic device design by opening the eyes of the design process to create more nimble, innovative, and disruptive diagnostic products within an increasingly competitive climate.
