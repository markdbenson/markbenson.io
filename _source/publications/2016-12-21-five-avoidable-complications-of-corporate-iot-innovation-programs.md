> ABSTRACT: As the Internet of Things (IoT) moves from early hype to production deployments, organizations that have historically made physical things now face significant challenges. Not only do they need to connect their products to the internet, but also support them. Because of this, many IoT innovation efforts take longer than expected or flounder without clear direction. Based on experience working with companies on IoT innovation programs across industries such as smart home automation, smart buildings and smart industrial equipment, this article describes five main symptoms of IoT programs that are destined for trouble and presents best practices for overcoming them.
