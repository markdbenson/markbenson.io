Presented at IoT Evolution 2016 in Las Vegas:

> ABSTRACT: There is an epic battle going on right now between disruptive innovation and an immovable object. The disruptive innovation is emerging connectivity technology and service-based business models that are changing the way that consumers interact with their devices, their environments, and their data. The immovable object is the inability of large organizations to successfully make the changes necessary to become a progressive data-driven company that listens to its users. Here, a contrasting set of successful and non-successful case studies are shown along with recommendations as to how companies can make the difficult changes ahead in order to compete and compete well in our emerging digital economy.
