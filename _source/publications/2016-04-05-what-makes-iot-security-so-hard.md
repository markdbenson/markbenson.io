[Published](https://securityledger.com/2016/04/opinion-what-makes-iot-security-so-hard/) in the [Security Ledger](https://securityledger.com/):

> ABSTRACT: As devices all around us become connected to the Internet, manufacturers of durable goods are finding themselves with the uncomfortable responsibility of solving security and personal privacy problems.
