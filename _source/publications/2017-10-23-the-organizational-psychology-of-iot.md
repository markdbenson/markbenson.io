[Published][ln1] a piece in [IoT Agenda][ln2] on the organizational psychology of the Internet of Things, centered on the interplay between team structure and software innovation, and how Conway's Law shows us that organizational design should be thought of in the service of digital innovation instead of its inverse.

> ABSTRACT: Smart connected products will redefine entire markets and the very nature of competition over the coming decade. Organizations attempting to build smart connected products across divisions, product portfolios, and markets are being faced with a stark reality: creating IoT projects are hard and building a long-term organizational competency around doing IoT projects with excellence is even harder. Based on real-world experience, this article covers five key barriers to digital transformation, an organizational competency model for how companies become masterful at IoT, four case studies, and five behaviors that successful organizations embrace to drive lasting behavioral change.
