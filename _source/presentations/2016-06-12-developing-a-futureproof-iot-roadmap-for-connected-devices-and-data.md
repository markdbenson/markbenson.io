Presented at [Sensors Expo](http://www.sensorsexpo.com/) 2016 in San Jose:

> ABSTRACT: IoT device fleets are becoming more pervasive. As devices are becoming connected to the Internet, new possibilities for how to use the data are opening up. For any IoT solution, there are steps of maturity that occur in sequence: (1) connected, (2) managed, and (3) optimized. Data analytics maturity mirrors these three steps: (1) when devices are connected we can get some descriptive data about them; (2) when devices are managed, we can generate predictive analytics on them to figure out what might happen in the future such as with a motor failure; and (3) we can optimize devices and user interactions by using prescriptive analytics to provide closed loop feedback. This article lays out the foundations of data analytics and data science for IoT device deployments as well as recommendations for making an IoT roadmap future-proof.
