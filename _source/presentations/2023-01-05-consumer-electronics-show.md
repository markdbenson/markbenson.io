> ABSTRACT: This ethos of consumer-first innovation is the center of what we do at SmartThings. With the SmartThings platform, we donâ€™t want users to feel like they need to change their behaviors to enjoy smart home experiences that make them feel safe, make life a little easier and also add a little fun.
>
> Our goal is for SmartThings to be so in tune with user behaviors that it is capable of independently running your home, your connections with family or whatever else you need. This is why we get so excited when we introduce things like SmartThings Station, or we uplevel our collaboration with the Matter standard, as together, they are a roadmap of our mission to make SmartThings the core enabler of our vision for a better-connected world that is truly centered around the user.
