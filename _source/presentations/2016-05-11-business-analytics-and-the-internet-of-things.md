Presented at [Vantage Advanced Professional Studies, Minnetonka](https://www.minnetonkaschools.org/academics/mhs/vantage):

> ABSTRACT: The Internet of Things represents a new twist on the profession of business analytics. With the advent of smart and connected devices, new types of data are becoming available that enable business analysts to gain deep insight into not only how a business operates internally, but how its machines operate in the world, how they are distributed and sold, and how they are used by people. This presentation has three parts: (1) introduction to the Internet of Things for business analysts, (2) three case studies that show how business analysis is used in action on Internet of Things projects, and (3) perspectives on the future of business analytics as we live in an increasingly connected world.
