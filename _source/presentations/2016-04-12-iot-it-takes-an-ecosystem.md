Presented at [IoT Fuse](https://iotfuse.com/) 2016 in Minneapolis:

> ABSTRACT: Manufacturers looking to create profitable Internet-connected products are faced with numerous challenges: new technologies, new business models, a volatile competitive landscape, and an emerging set of customer needs and wants. In order to bring a connected product to market, these manufacturers must learn to embrace an expanding and ever-changing multitude of technologies and services that must be made to work in harmony. Doing this well depends on how effective an organization is at embracing change and transforming operations to support the new direction. This keynote panel presents key considerations and recommendations for manufacturers to consider in order to build a profitable and growing business based on digital customer experiences.
