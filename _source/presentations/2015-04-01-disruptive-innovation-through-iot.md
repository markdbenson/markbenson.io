Presented at [Financial Executives International](https://www.financialexecutives.org/) 2015 in Minneapolis.

> ABSTRACT: As the new connected device economy emerges, financial executives in healthcare, banking, industrial, manufacturing, energy, and consumer product companies are under increasing pressure to reduce expenses and create new revenue sources to remain competitive in the marketplace. With the Internet of Things, there are two kinds of companies: those that disrupt and those that will be disrupted. This talk explores ways that financial executives can lead their companies through transformational change to disrupt their industry by reducing costs, increasing operational efficiencies, and innovating new business models that connect better with customers, reduce business risks, and make it easier to comply with regulatory requirements.
