> ABSTRACT: The smart home industry is in the midst of an inflection point. The pandemic has made people reimagine their homes beyond just a static space to live. This effect has given rise to the need for better interoperability and ease of use for smart home devices, and experiences that they enable. In addition to the consumer trends, the industry is also coming together around a smart home connectivity standard called Matter, which aims to simplify the setup, onboarding, and use of smart home devices in a way that is easier to understand and use. In order for the industry to come together in this way, it requires companies to come together on this common standard, while still leaving lots of room for innovation and differentiation when it comes to advanced product features and services such as pet care, elder care, and energy.
