[Keynote presentation][ln1] at [Smart IoT London][ln2], by Mark Benson:

> ABSTRACT: As the Internet of Things moves from early hype to production deployments, organizations that have historically made physical things now face significant challenges. Not only do they need to connect their products to the Internet, but also support them. Because of this, I’ve seen many IoT innovation efforts take longer than expected or flounder without clear direction. Companies learn  sometimes the hard way  that it’s one thing to talk idyllically about turning a product-centered business into a service-centered utopia, but quite another to actually make it a reality. This talk will focus on the five symptoms of IoT programs that are destined for trouble and will also provide solutions for getting back on track.
