Presented at [IoT Fuse](https://iotfuse.com/) 2015 in Minneapolis.

> ABSTRACT: The Internet of Things is more than a market – it’s a new wave of the Internet. It is predicted that fifty billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020. However, in order for us to get there, certain maturity milestones must be achieved by the global Internet of Things movement that enable that growth in each of the markets that it applies to. If these milestones are not met, the IoT will not meet it’s full potential. In this talk, a five-phase model of market maturity is introduced along with parallels in other historical markets that have made it through all the phases of market maturity and achieved scale of massive proportions. This presentation concludes with a list of actionable steps that attendees can take to break down walls, develop new technologies, and innovate new product ideas that solve real-world problems in a way that ushers the global IoT movement successfully through the five phases of market maturity and into the history books.
