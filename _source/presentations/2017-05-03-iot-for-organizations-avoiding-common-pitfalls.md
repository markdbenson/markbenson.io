[Presented][ln1] at the [IoT Systems Research Center][ln2] at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison][ln3] on how organizational cognition, behavior, and change are central levers for building a lasting IoT competency:

> ABSTRACT: Smart connected products will redefine entire markets and the very nature of competition over the coming decade. Organizations attempting to build smart connected products across divisions, product portfolios, and markets are being faced with a stark reality: creating IoT projects are hard and building a long-term organizational competency around doing IoT projects with excellence is even harder. Based on real-world experience, this presentation covers five key behaviors (and corresponding pitfalls) that successful organizations exhibit along their IoT journey.
