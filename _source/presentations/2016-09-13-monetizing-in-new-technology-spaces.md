Presentation and facilitated think-tank session at [Frost & Sullivan Growth, Innovation, and Leadership, Silicon Valley 2016](http://ww2.frost.com/event/calendar/transformational-growth-strategies-future-proof-your-business/):

> ABSTRACT: The Internet of Things trend is forcing organizations out of their comfort zones to rapidly innovate new technology and business offerings in order to remain competitive on the global stage. However, to succeed at monetizing in new technology spaces, organizations must overcome internal barriers to change such as technology debt, rigid business models, outdated user experiences, incumbent processes, skill gaps, and in many cases (sadly), a lack of strategic vision. This session uses interactive group discussion, frameworks, lessons learned, best practices, metrics, and business model case studies to help participants address these challenges at their organization.
