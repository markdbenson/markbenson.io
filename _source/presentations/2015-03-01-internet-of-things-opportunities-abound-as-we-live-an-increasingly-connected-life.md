Presented at the [Minnesota High Tech Association](https://www.mhta.org/) Tech.2015 conference in Minneapolis.

> ABSTRACT: The Internet of Things is on the verge of touching all aspects of our lives from the home to the office, factory, operating room, and battlefield. Although the future of IoT is yet to be written, its success will be found when technology is developed to solve problems instead of looking for problems. This talk focuses on the opportunities for local Minnesota durable goods companies to reinvent their product portfolios, reduce expenses, increase revenue, add product differentiation, reduce risk, make it easier to comply with regulatory requirements, and increase safety.
