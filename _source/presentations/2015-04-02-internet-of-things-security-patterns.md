Presented at [Internet of Things Stream Conference](http://www.streamconf.com/) 2015 in San Francisco.

> ABSTRACT: The growth of IoT is occurring at an incredible rate, justly raising alarms about security and privacy issues as we become increasingly reliant on these intelligent, interconnected devices in our lives and businesses. How are we to protect billions of devices from attacks and intrusions that could compromise our personal privacy, public safety, or business viability? Building an IoT solution involves securing sensors, devices, networks, cloud platforms, web applications, and mobile applications for diverse industries. This presentation examines the landscape of emerging security challenges posed by connected devices and offers a catalog of security deployment patterns that have been successfully used by some of the worldâ€™s most well known OEMs to deploy connected product fleets.
