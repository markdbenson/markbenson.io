Presented at [IoT Evolution](http://www.iotevolutionexpo.com/) 2016 in Las Vegas: 

> ABSTRACT: The stickiness of a connected product brand is a combination of user experience UX relevance and the degree to which the product garners trust. As such, the product design process should carefully consider the UX to ensure that product features and usage modes are relevant, easy to understand, and enjoyable to use. By looking at a case study of an award-winning smart device enabled garage door controller by Genie called the Aladdin Connect as an illustration, weâ€™ll examine how connected products are (A) becoming the new normal for consumers, (B) closing the intimacy gap between OEMs and consumers, and (C) enabling competitive interoperability in a way that is changing the competitive landscape and influencing consumer buying decisions.
