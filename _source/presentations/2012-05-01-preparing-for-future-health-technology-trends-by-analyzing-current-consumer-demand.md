[Presentation](http://www.logicpd.com/news/press-releases/logic-pd-to-speak-at-worlds-largest-telehealth-conference-ata-2012/) at the [American Telemedicine Association (ATA) Conference](http://www.americantelemed.org/), by Mark Benson. 

> ABSTRACT: Slow regulatory cycles combined with the reality of fast-moving technology curves can cause new homecare telemedicine products to feel old to users that have the latest consumer technology in their pocket.

> This presentation explores problems and potential solutions to combating this effect. 

> Problems include (A) fast-moving consumer technology keeps setting the bar for user interaction and design standards, (B) keeping current with latest technology often requires the creation of non-standard proprietary solutions, and (C) the desire to exert control over the safety and efficacy of a medical product causes medical device companies to naturally trend towards vertical integration, and trend away from horizontal market relevance. 

> This presentation presents possible solutions to each of these problems, but above all, argues that a careful and smart approach to interaction design is the key to wide-spread adoption and success.
