> ABSTRACT: As alarm systems, thermostats, air conditioners and other home devices become increasingly connected, the next generation of residents are seeking to drive value and convenience by creating a tailored, technology-enabled environmental experience in their homes. As a result, developers and property managers are investing in the value of creating connected living experiences. This presentation has three parts, (A) how resident behavior and expectations for smart homes is changing, (B) how [Commscope Ruckus][ln1] and [Samsung][ln2] [SmartThings][ln3] are working together to provide innovative solutions for the industry, and (C) how partners can engage with Ruckus and SmartThings to build solutions for next generation convenience, safety, security, peace of mind, and improved energy efficiency for residents.
