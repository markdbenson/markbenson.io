Honored to take part in the [Samsung eXperience][ln1] 2024 event at the Venetian in Las Vegas. During the event, I was interviewed on stage as part of a thought leadership and innovation segment on the state of the smart home in the US, recent product announcements, and what people can look forward to in the future.

> ABSTRACT: This fireside chat with Mark Benson focuses on innovation as it relates to the smart home in the US including user trends, device category trends, use case trends, economic trends, and demographic shifts. In addition, Mark will share the latest SmartThings product announcements and what may be coming in the future.
