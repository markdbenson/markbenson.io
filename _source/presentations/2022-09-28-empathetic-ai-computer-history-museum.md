Honored to deliver a keynote presentation for the [Edge Impulse Imagine][ln1] event at the Museum of [Computer History Museum][ln2] in Mountain View, CA on how the pandemic has changed people's relationships with their homes, emerging expectations of smart home experiences, and the critical importance of empathy-centered design thinking.

> Abstract: The pandemic has forever changed the world and how we think about our lives, our work, and our relationships with people and our surroundings. Our homes have been reimagined, perhaps as they were originally intended, as places of rest, relaxation, and safety -- and more recently, as places of work and exercise. As a result, people want their homes to be better. To work for them and be customized to their needs.
> 
> But in order to meet these evolving user needs, smart home brands and ecosystems must innovate in new ways, collaborate together, and be obsessed with delivering valuable experiences for users.
>
> This presentation explains how the pandemic has permanently altered the complexion and trajectory of the smart home industry, the central role that radical empathy plays when innovating new product concepts at the edge, and how to overcome internal and external barriers to change in order to make a lasting difference in the lives of users.
