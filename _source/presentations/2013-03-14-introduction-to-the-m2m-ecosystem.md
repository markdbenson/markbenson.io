Presented at the inaugural [IoT Meetup in Minneapolis, MN](http://www.meetup.com/IoTTwinCitiesMN/), by Mark Benson.

> ABSTRACT: The Internet of Things (IoT) movement makes grand promises to internet-enable everything from stop signs to kitchen appliances, each of which requires machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. However, the vocabulary has not been standardized, new product categories are emerging, and consensus standards are immature. This presentation offers three perspectives of what M2M means, how to think about and navigate the M2M ecosystem, and trends to watch for in the coming years.
