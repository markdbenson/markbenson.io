[Presentation](http://www.logicpd.com/news/press-releases/logic-pds-director-of-software-strategy-to-speak-at-design-west/) at [Design West (was Embedded Systems Conference (ESC)](http://www.ubmdesign.com/), by Mark Benson. 

> ABSTRACT: Thanks to the laws of physics and the practical limits on rates of thermal heat dissipation, CPU clock cycles in integrated circuits are no longer increasing year-over-year at the same rate that memory densities are. 

> For this reason, we have seen a proliferation of multi-core CPUs for commercial desktop PCs, and are now beginning to see this trend impact embedded systems as well. 

> This presentation explains intersecting variables of performance, power, and complexity, and how these variables change dynamically in a multi-core embedded environment.  

> The primary focus of this presentation is to delineate tools and techniques for managing homogeneous and heterogeneous embedded cores through intelligent architectural decomposition, particularly when low-power design is a primary constraint.
