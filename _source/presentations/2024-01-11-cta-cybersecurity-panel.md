Honored to speak on a US Cyber Trust Mark panel called, ["A Secured IoT World?: Programs, Rules, Brands, Retailers and Consumers"][ln1] along with Michael Dolan (Senior Director, Head of Enterprise Privacy and Data Protection, Best Buy), Kat Megas (Cybersecurity for IoT Program Head, NIST), Scott Register (Vice President, Security Solutions, Keysight Technologies), and moderated by Mike Bergman (Vice president, Technology and Standards, Consumer Technology Association).

> ABSTRACT: The Internet of Things (IoT) enhances how we live, work and play. Increased adoption of connected devices prompts questions about how to effectively address security of these devices, protect the networks they run on and safeguard the data they collect. 
> 
> A public-private sector effort led by the White House, with input from CTA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other government and private sector stakeholders is developing a voluntary cybersecurity label program for consumer connected devices (consumer IoT). The U.S. Cyber Trust Mark program will give consumers more information about the cybersecurity of the connected products they buy and ensure that those products meet certain standards.
> 
> This panel discusses the implications of the US Cyber Trust Mark, the EU CRA, and other related programs.
