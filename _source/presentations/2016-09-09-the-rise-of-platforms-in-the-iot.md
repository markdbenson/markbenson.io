Presented at the [Peggy Smedley Institute](http://learnitiot.com/) 2016 in Del Mar, CA:

> ABSTRACT: As manufacturers begin creating smart, connected products, a flurry of IoT platform technologies have emerged. However, it is still in the early days of IoT platform maturity and many platforms suffer from a lack of features, security guarantees, scalability concerns, and inflexible interfaces. This presentation by Mark Benson, Exosite, explains the concept of an IoT platform, what problems it solves, and how to make buying decisions when looking for an IoT platform for your connected business.
