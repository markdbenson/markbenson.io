Honored to open the technology track at the [University of Wisconsin Madison][ln1] [E-Business Consortium][ln2] [annual conference][ln3] with lessons learned and a perspective on the future of smart connected product design.

> Abstract: Connected products are reshaping the way consumers live and how companies deliver value. In this session, Mark Benson, Head of SmartThings at Samsung, will explore the rapid evolution of connected devices from two key perspectives: the industry-wide shift toward smart ecosystems and the experience of companies that design and build these products. Drawing on Samsung’s leadership in the connected home and IoT space, Mark will share lessons learned from developing SmartThings, including the challenges of interoperability, the role of data in creating seamless experiences, and the future of consumer expectations. Whether you are building smart products or adapting your business to work within a connected world, this session offers a front-row view into what is next.
