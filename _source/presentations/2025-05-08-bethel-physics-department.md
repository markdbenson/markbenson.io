Honored to present to the [Bethel University Physics and Engineering Department][ln1] about smart home tech, my career in software engineering, and ways students can think about integrating calling, character, and conviction in their careers to make an impact in the world.

> ABSTRACT: In this talk, Mark Benson, CEO of SmartThings and Bethel University graduate, reflects on his journey from college student to technology leader. He shares how his experiences at Bethel helped shape his character, priorities, and understanding of leadership. Drawing from his work at SmartThings and Samsung, Mark explores how faith and work continue to intersect in meaningful waysâ€”through decisions grounded in trust, humility, and integrity. This talk invites students and emerging leaders to reflect on calling, character, and what it means to lead with conviction in a complex, fast-moving world.
