[Keynote presentation](http://www.rtecc.com/conferences/view/47) at the [Real-Time & Embedded Computing Conference (RTECC)](http://www.rtecc.com/) in Minneapolis, MN, by Mark Benson.

> ABSTRACT: Due to the recent increased rate of Android adoption for mobile computing platforms, a natural question arises for embedded product developers and leaders regarding how to engage with the movement and leverage its success. 

> By using the economic model of Cross-Elasticity of Demand (XED), we can come up with a framework that guides our thinking about how the changing price point for one product family (i.e. the adoption of Android), affects the demand for another (i.e. a given corporate software product roadmap). 

> This presentation attempts to introduce such a framework by analyzing (A) independent products in the marketplace, (B) substitute products in the marketplace, and (C) complementary products in the market place, with the goal of enabling intelligent and timely business decisions within a dynamic technical climate.
