Presented at [IoT Evolution](http://www.iotevolutionexpo.com/) 2016, Las Vegas:

> ABSTRACT: Most organizations leverage multiple software packages, each with their own data and dashboard systems. These systems are in addition to corporate dash-boarding frameworks that are used to drive business decisions. The Internet of Things represents an opportunity to aggregate data from multiple data sources into a format that enhances the efficiency of the business decision making process. This presentation examines the way in which the IoT creates both challenges and opportunities for business process optimization, organizational alignment, and technology innovation. The presiding conclusion in this presentation is that corporate dashboards are only useful when they are actionable, and if an IoT solution doesnâ€™t have a clear path to create actionable results, a more basic approach should first be taken which seeks to understand customer and business needs prior to making a larger IoT investment.
