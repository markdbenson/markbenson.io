[Featured][ln1] in a piece by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy about the Matter smart home standard and the momentum it gained through widespread support by leading smart home brands at CES 2022 in Las Vegas.

> All of this gives us a much better feel for what Matter will bring with it when it finally arrives, it’s currently scheduled for June 2022. But let’s take a step back and assess now that CES is over and we’re faced with a bleak mid-winter before Matter gets here.
